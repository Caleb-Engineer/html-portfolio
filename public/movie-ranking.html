<h1>The Best Movies According to Caleb</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>
  This movie is more than a tale of adventure; it's a profound exploration<br />
  of growth and transformation. It begins in the idyllic Shire,<br />
  a symbol of innocence and home, where Frodo and Sam are bound<br />
  by self-imposed limitations. As they embark on a perilous journey,<br />
  they transcend those boundaries, evolving in character and perspective.<br />
  The contrast between the peaceful Shire and the demanding road ahead<br />
  enchants viewers and draws them into a world where bravery and<br />
  friendship conquer fear. My love for this film lies not just in its epic<br />
  storytelling but in its ability to reveal the hidden strength within the
  most<br />
  unlikely heroes, reflecting a universal truth about human potential and
  resilience. <br />
</p>
<h3>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>
  I could go on about this movie all day. I love colorful, creative, and highly
  rich animation films.<br />
  I especially love how this film broke out of the all too predicatable
  Spider-Man <br />mold and surprised me in a way that will be cherished for
  years to come!
</p>
<h3>The Incredibles</h3>
<p>Great watch! Very wholesome and creative!</p>

<h4>Movie Poem</h4>
<p>
  In lands of Middle-earth, a quest begins,<br />
  A fellowship united, a battle to win,<br />
  Rings of power, friendships true,<br />
  A journey vast for a chosen few.<br />
</p>
<p>
  a web of worlds, young Spider-Men meet,<br />
  With leaps and bounds, villains to defeat,<br />
  A universe vast, colors bright,<br />
  Heroes emerge in the endless night.<br />
</p>
<p>
  A family strong, yet ordinary too,<br />
  Incredibles they are, with powers to pursue,<br />
  Love and strength in every scene,<br />
  Together they fight, a marvelous team.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Three tales unfold, diverse and grand,<br />
  Adventure, courage, across the land,<br />
  From mystical realms to city streets,<br />
  These stories enchant, and never retreat.<br />
