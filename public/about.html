<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Welcome! My name is Caleb. I am currently on<br />
  a journey to learn more about website design, AI, and tech.
</p>

<p>
  So far I really enjoy full-stack engineering. Web development is<br />
  a super useful skill that may be used for content creation, which
  <br />happens to be something that I am passionate about. However,<br />
  I view website design as more of a stepping stone to my desired<br />
  end goal of content creation rather than my primary focus.
</p>

<p>
  I also have a strong interest in the latest developments on AI and tech.
  <br />I plan on becoming more proficient in these areas.
</p>

<p>
  Hopefully, everything works out for the best! Only time will tell. <br />The
  only thing I can do in the moment is to enjoy the journey.
</p>
